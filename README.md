# Dev Container

This contains all of the setup to allow for various configurations for doing development. Simply build the container, passing in the appropriate build arguments to get the container you need to run your application.

## Example Builds

Build a container for a dotnet application using 2.1

```bash
podman build --build-arg INSTALL_DOTNET=true --build-arg DOTNET_VERSION=2.1 -t dev-container:local .
```

Build a container for a java 8 application with maven

```bash
podman build --build-arg JAVA_VERSION=8 --build-arg INSTALL_MAVEN=true -t dev-container:local .
```

Build a container for a java app with maven and node

```bash
podman build --build-arg INSTALL_MAVEN=true --build-arg INSTALL_NODE=true -t dev-container:local .
```

## Running a Container

Once the container is built, you can get into it using the name you tagged it. In the examples above, we named the container `dev-container`. This uses the `zsh` shell.

```bash
podman run --rm -v ${PWD}:/home/dev/app -it dev-container:local /bin/zsh
```

Once in the container, you should have the tools necessary to develop your application.

If you've enabled podman, then you need to run the container as privileged

```bash
podman run --rm -v ${PWD}:/home/dev/app -it --privileged=true dev-conainer:local /bin/zsh
```

## Running with VSCode

Once the container is built, you can use it within VSCode to do your development. First, start your container, mounting all the things that make sense. Here is what I use:

```shell
podman run -d -v ssh:/home/dev/.ssh -v /home/sturdy5/workspaces:/home/dev/workspaces -v app:/home/dev/apps --name dev-container dev-container:local
```

If you've enabled podman in your container, be sure to run it as privileged

```shell
--privileged
```

By default, the container will start up an nginx server so that it stays running.

Then you have to install the [Dev Containers extension in VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)

Start a VSCode instance attached to your running container

1. Open VSCode locally
1. Click on the green icon at the bottom left
1. Select "Attach to Running Container..."
1. Select the dev-container you started above
